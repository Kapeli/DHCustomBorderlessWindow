DHCustomBorderlessWindow
==================

Custom NSWindow which behaves like a regular titled window (and is actually a titled window), but looks and behaves like a borderless window.

The goal was to end up with a borderless window which can be resized from all 4 edges, like a regular window.

Warning: I have no idea how reliable this is, only barely tested it on OS X 10.8. This will be used as a new HUD style for [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash).
